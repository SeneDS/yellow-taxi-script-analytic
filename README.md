## Business Questions

These questions focus on trends, seasonality, and long-term insights, emphasizing why analyzing multiple months of data is crucial.  

### **Market Demand & Seasonality**  
1. **How does the demand for yellow taxis fluctuate over time (daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonally)?**  
2. **What are the peak hours for yellow taxi trips in different boroughs and zones?**  
3. **How do weather conditions or major events (holidays, sports events) impact yellow taxi usage over time?**  

### **Customer Behavior & Ride Characteristics**  
4. **What are the most popular pickup and drop-off locations, and how do they change over time?**  
5. **What is the average trip distance, and how does it vary by borough, time of day, and season?**  
6. **How many trips have only one passenger versus multiple passengers, and does this change seasonally?**  

### **Financial & Pricing Analysis**  
7. **How does the total fare revenue of yellow taxis change over time?**  
8. **What is the average fare per trip, and how does it vary by borough, time of day, and trip distance?**  
9. **What is the proportion of different payment types (credit card, cash, etc.), and has it changed over time?**  
10. **How often do passengers tip, and what factors (time of day, borough, fare amount) influence tip amounts?**  
11. **How much revenue is generated from additional charges (MTA tax, congestion surcharge, airport fees), and has it changed over time?**  

### **Competitive Insights & Operational Efficiency**  
12. **Which boroughs or zones have the highest and lowest trip volumes, and how do they compare over time?**  
13. **How frequently do yellow taxis serve airports (JFK, LaGuardia, Newark), and what is the average fare for these trips?**  
14. **How often do taxis use different rate codes (e.g., standard rate vs. negotiated fares), and how do these rates vary across boroughs?**  
15. **How long do trips typically take, and is there a trend of increasing or decreasing trip durations over time?**  

These insights will help you understand market demand, customer behavior, and financial trends, providing a solid foundation for competing against yellow taxis in NYC.
